## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. My passion for software development is what drives me to excel in my studies and explore the latest technologies and programming languages.

👨‍💻 Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently demonstrated a dedication to excellence in my coursework and projects. I have honed my skills in various programming languages and I am well-versed in software engineering principles and practices. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have actively sought out opportunities to gain practical experience in software development. I have participated in a summer internship at 3SS (3 Screen Solutions) where I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project where I developed an Android application that simulated a marketplace. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in developing mobile applications and working as part of a team in a professional setting. As an intern, I was able to apply the skills and knowledge I gained through my academic studies to a real-world project, which allowed me to deepen my understanding of the development process and work with cutting-edge technology. I was able to work alongside experienced developers and gain valuable insights into the industry.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from **fitness**, **listening to music**, and **reading** .

📚 How I said,I also love reading books on **personal development** & **financial literacy**. My favorite ones are **Atomic Habits** by _James Clear_ in the genre of personal development and **Rich Dad Poor Dad** by _Robert Kiyosaki_ in the genre of financial literacy.

✈️ I love **traveling** too.
